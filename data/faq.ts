  {
    question: "How accurate is the transliteration?",
    answer:
      "TypeBharat uses advanced phonetic mapping to provide highly accurate transliteration. For common words and phrases, accuracy is excellent. The tool also provides suggestions for ambiguous words, allowing you to choose the most appropriate option. As with any automated tool, reviewing your text for context-specific nuances is always a good practice.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this a translation tool?",
    answer:
      "No, TypeBharat is a transliteration tool, not a translation tool. Transliteration converts the script (the way words are written) while keeping the same sounds and meaning. Translation converts the meaning from one language to another. If you type &quot;hello,&quot; it won&apos;t convert it to &quot;namaste&quot;—it will convert it to &quot;हैलो&quot; (the same word in a different script).",
  },

  },
  {
    question: "What if I find an error in the transliteration?",
    answer: "You can manually edit any text in the output area before copying it. If you consistently find errors with specific words, please let us know through our feedback form. We continuously improve our phonetic mappings based on user input.",
